# JavaFundamentals
Compilation of Java code and explanations for various concepts 


####Useful Concepts

#####Data Structure Overview
**Array**  - Quick insertion, fast access if index known - slow search, slow deletion, fixed size
**Ordered array** - Quicker search than regular array - slow insertion/deletion, fixed size
**Stack** - Provides last in, first out access - slow access to other items (need to pop from stack)
**Queue** - provides first in, first out access - slow access to other items 
**Linked List** - quick insertion, quick deletion - slow search
**Binary Tree** - quick search, insertion, deletion (if tree is balanced) - deletion algorithm can be complex
**Red-black tree** - quick search, insertion, deletion (tree always balanced) - complex
**2-3-4 tree** - same as red-black-tree - complex
**Hash table** - very fast access if key is known / fast insertion - slow deletion, access slow if key not known, inefficient memory usage
**Heap** - fast insertion, deletion - slow access to other items, access to largest item
**Graph* - models real-world situations - some algorithms are slow and complex

**Object** - an instance of a class
**Class** - blueprint of what an object is capable of and attributes that it has
